asks: "Are you up or are you down?"

input, up, down; if up, []; if down, [].

asks: "is it light there? or still dark?"

input, light, dark; if light, []; if dark, [].

asks: "what are you going to do next?"

description of events, choice.

take 2; [rough format for how one round of ask/input pattern goes]

asks: "Are you up or are you down?"

waits for input, asking: "[Answer 'up' or 'down' by pressing the 'u' or 'd' keys]"

input listener: if u, let person var direction = "up"; if d, let person var direction = "down";

output answer as test;

failing output would be non-d/u, which can be tested first with just one char as most basic;
